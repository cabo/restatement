      "body": "\r\n> One thing is I was surprised when working on RFC8995 was that the words\r\n\"Anti-Pattern\" were not that well known in the IETF.\r\n\r\n> I can't recall hearing \"anti-pattern\" used in this way before and think it is a confusing term we should avoid. The meaning of the \"anti-\" as being opposed to something else is well known, as in antidisestablishmentarianism (or preceding it as in antediluvian). So I think someone seeing this for the first time will assume it means something opposed to having a pattern, i.e., chaos. Seems like it would be better to use something like \"bad pattern\" or, in this case, \"malpractice\", I suggest changing the draft title to \"The Restatement Malpractice\" as something the more people will easily understand.\r\n\r\n> We aren't making the term \"anti-pattern\" up - it's been in the wild for a _long_ time now.\r\n\r\n> What really draws me to this concept and the word expressing it is the rather sharp definition (Wikipedia again):\r\n>\r\n>\t\u2022 The anti-pattern is a commonly-used process, structure or pattern of action that, despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good ones.\r\n>\r\n> Words like \u201cmalpractice\u201d don\u2019t quite capture this rich meaning.\r\n\r\nsnippets from rfcinterest mailing list, thread <https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rfc-interest/fFxkiLpLohQABQH7NIxrCR5bjdM>",
